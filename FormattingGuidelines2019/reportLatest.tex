\section{Introduction}

This paper talks about the steps that we took in designing an AI Poker Player agent in Heads Up Limit Texas Hold'em. An agent that is subjected to reinforcement learning must learn to interact with the environment in order to maximize its reward. Reinforcement learning was chosen as a way to get the best possible action based on the current state. Pruning methods such as grouping cards with similar values were used to cut down the size of the search tree. 

The problem with Limit Texas Hold'em is that there is no input or output training data sets available for the agent to gather feedback from. Hence, the only way an agent can learn is by trial and error based on feedback from its own actions and experiences. A reward function where actions that led to positive outcomes are rewarded, and actions that led to negative outcomes are punished is created, with the goal of maximizing its reward. The design of a reward function good enough for the agent to master poker is the basis for this project. In a game of poker, the agent does not have a complete model of the environment, nor does it know the states that its actions will lead to. Thus, a Q-learning agent, which compares the expected utilities of the remaining choices without the need to know the outcomes nor the model of the environment, is our agent design of choice as it fits the scenario of a poker game.

\section{Pre-Flop Hand Strength}

To begin with, we wanted decide how the bot will determine the strength of its hand, just from the pre-flop round. Due to the limited amount of information that we can manipulate during pre-flop round, the strength of a hand at pre-flop is determined by the probability of winning simply based on the prior knowledge of the two private cards currently in hand. In order to estimate this probability and thus the strength of a hand, we simulated 10000 games for each possible combination of starting hand. We then calculate the probability of winning based on the starting hand by dividing the number of wins with the total number of games played, which is 10000 in our case.

The estimated probabilities of winning given the following starting hands is as seen in Figure \ref{fig:1}.
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{WinningProb.PNG}
  \caption{Estimated winning probabilities with starting hands}
  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

At each pre-flop street, the bot will decide its actions based on the starting hand's estimated probabilities of winning, which are:
\begin{displaymath}
  \left.
  \begin{array}{l}
    raise \text{: } Pr(Win) > k
    call \text{: } Pr(Win) > j \\
    fold \text{: } Pr(Win) \leq j
  \end{array}
  \right\rbrace \quad \text{where } 0 < j < k \leq 1
\end{displaymath}

\section{Post-Flop Rounds}

In the subsequent post-flop rounds, reinforcement learning is employed. Specifically, the technique of Q-learning, which was described in the Introduction, was used to train our agent.

In Q-learning, we maintain a table of states and actions as inputs for the agent. Each permutation generates an expected reward. An illustration of it can be seen in Table 2.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ c|c|c|c }
	\hline
	\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{State}}&\multicolumn{3}{|c}{\textbf{Action}}\\
	\cline{2-4}
	& $fold$ & $call$ & $raise$\\ 
	\hline
	1\\
	2\\ 
	3\\ 
	$\cdots$\\
	S\\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Q-learning Training}
    \label{tab:table2}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
After each training round, the state of each permutation is updated based on the formula
\begin{displaymath}
Q\left(s',a'\right)=Q\left(s,a\right)+\sum_{0}^{t}\lambda^{t}R_t\left(s,a\right)
\end{displaymath}
where $t$ is the number of turns between the move and the terminal node, $R_t$ is the reward for round $t$, and $\lambda$ is the discount factor.

\begin{displaymath}
  R_t=
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{l}
    +\frac{pot}{2}\quad\text{if win,} \\
    -\frac{pot}{2}\quad\text{otherwise}
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  \lambda=\text{discount rate for future reward}
\end{displaymath}

\section{$\epsilon$-Greedy Algorithm}

At every turn, with a probability of $\epsilon$, a random action is chosen to be performed, otherwise an action with the best expected reward is chosen.

The value of $\epsilon$ will slowly decrease as the agent acquires more training. A relatively large initial value ensures that all possible paths will be explored before the agent settles into a sub-optimal pattern. The $State$ and $Action$ for the $\epsilon$-Greedy Algorithm is

\begin{displaymath}
State = \{ HS\text{, }HP\text{, }S\text{, }P\text{, }\#OR\text{, }\#SR\text{, }AF\}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
Actions = \{ fold\text{, }call\text{, }raise \}
\end{displaymath}
where

\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=8mm]
\item [\emph{HS}]is the current Hand Strength of a given player.
\item [\emph{HP}]is the current Hand Potential of a given player.
\item [\emph{S}]is the Street, which is the start of each new round.
\item [\emph{P}]is the Pot, which is the total amount in the player's bet.
\item [\emph{\#OR}]is the Opponent-Raise, which is the number of raises by the opponent per street.
\item [\emph{\#SR}]is the Self-Raise, which is the number of raises by the AI itself per street
\item [\emph{OPS}]is the Opponent Playing Style, which classifies the opponent's style of play into four categories.
\end{description}

\section{Opponent Playing Styles}

The opponent player can be classified under four categories of playing styles. Each style describes the frequency of play and how the player bets. The four playing styles are loose/passive, loose/tight, conservative/passive and conservative/tight. They are determined by the Aggressive Factor and Player Tightness, which are calculated as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
  \text{Aggressive Factor, } AF = \frac{\text{\# }raises}{\text{\# }calls}
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  \text{Player Tightness, } PT =  \frac{\text{\# }folds}{\text{\# }games} 
\end{displaymath} 

Later, a classification process is conducted to classify the opponent's style of play into four categories:

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
      \textbf{} & \textbf{AF $\leq$ 1} & \textbf{AF $>$ 1} \\
      \hline
      \textbf{PT $\geq$ 0.28} & loose/passive & loose/aggressive \\
      \textbf{PT $<$ 0.28} & conservative/passive & conservative/aggressive \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Style of Play Classification}
    \label{tab:table1}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Hand Strength}

The Hand Strength, $HS$ is the probability of the current hand of a given player winning if the game reaches a showdown. The $HS$ factors in all possible combinations of the opponents' hands, the remaining hidden board cards, and performing a comparison between the agent's hand and the hands in the enumeration to see which is better. The quality of the hand is then measured based on the number of times the  hand turns out to be better.

Given $n$ number of opponents, the remaining cards, $Rem$ is given by:
\begin{displaymath}
  Rem = \left[ \alpha \char`\\ \beta \right]^{5}
\end{displaymath}
where $\alpha$ is the set of all cards in the deck, and $\beta$ is the set of all hole cards of a particular player.
The formula to calculate the rank of each hand, $Rank(h)$ is:
\begin{displaymath}
  Rank(h) = max({\forall x \in [\beta \cup \Omega]^{5} : s(x)})
\end{displaymath}
where $\Omega$ is the set of community cards.
Having $Rem$ and $Rank(h)$, it is now possible to calculate $HS$ through the formulas below:
\begin{displaymath}
  Ahead(h) = \# \left\lbrace \forall x \in Rem:s(x) > Rank(h) \right\rbrace
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  Tied(h) = \# \left\lbrace \forall x \in Rem:s(x) = Rank(h) \right\rbrace
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  Behind(h) = \# \left\lbrace \forall x \in Rem:s(x) < Rank(h) \right\rbrace
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
  HS(h)= \left( \frac{Ahead(h)+\frac{Tied(h)}{2}}{Ahead(h) + Tied(h) + Behind(h)} \right)^{n}
\end{displaymath}




Note that the $E[HS]$ may be used at any round of the game. However, it does not address the possibility of the hand improving in future rounds of the game. To resolve this problem, the Hand Potential Formula is applied.

\section{Opponent Playing Styles}

Hand Potential is an extension of the Hand Strength algorithm, whereby instead of merely considering the available cards in hand and in the community pool, it also considers the as yet unrevealed community cards and possible opponent hands that might improve. In the River street, this algorithm will output the same result as Hand Strength.

Hand Potential can be split into Positive Potential, $PPot$ and Negative Potential $NPot$, which are defined as such:
\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=8mm]
\item [\emph{PPot}]All scenarios where the agent is behind but eventually wins.
\item [\emph{NPot}]All scenarios where the agent is ahead but eventually loses.
\end{description}

The algorithm for Hand Potential is described in detail via pseudo-code in Algorithm 1.

  \begin{algorithm}
   \caption{Hand Potential}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
      \Function{HandPotential}{$agCard$, $commCard$}              
        \State Let $HP[3][3]$ and $HPTotal[3]$ be new arrays
        \State $agRank \leftarrow Rank(agCard$, $commCard)$
        \For{\textbf{each} $opCard$}
            \State $opRank \leftarrow Rank(opCard$, $commCard)$
            \If{$agRank > opRank$}
              \State $index \leftarrow ahead$
            \ElsIf{$agRank == opRank$}
              \State $index \leftarrow tied$
            \Else
              \State $index \leftarrow behind$
            \EndIf
            \State $HPTotal[index]++$
            \For{\textbf{each} $scenario$}
              \State $agBest \leftarrow Rank(agCard, scenario)$
              \State $opBest \leftarrow Rank(opCard, scenario)$
              \If{$agBest > opBest$}
                \State $HP[index][ahead]++$
              \ElsIf{$agBest == opBest$}
                \State $HP[index][tied]++$
              \Else
                \State $HP[index][behind]++$
              \EndIf
            \EndFor
        \EndFor
        \State $PPot=\frac{HP[behind][ahead] + \frac{HP[behind][tied]}{2} +
  \frac{HP[tied][ahead]}{2})}{HPTotal[behind]+\frac{HPTotal[tied]}{2}}$
		\State $NPot = \frac{HP[ahead][behind] + \frac{HP[tied][behind]}{2} + \frac{HP[ahead][tied]}{2}}{HPTotal[ahead]+\frac{HPTotal[tied]}{2}}$
        \State\Return{$PPot$, $NPot$}
      \EndFunction
    \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}

\section{Effective Hand Strength}

The probability of winning, $Pr(Win)$, can be calculated as:
\begin{displaymath}
  Pr(Win) = HS * (1-NPot) + (1-HS) * PPot
\end{displaymath}
To calculate effective hand strength, $EHS$, we set $NPot=0$ since we want the probability of the hand being the best or improving to become the best. Thus, we eventually get the equation of $EHS$ to be:
\begin{displaymath}
  EHS = HS +(1-HS) * PPot
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Effective Hand Strength}

The Hand Potential algorithm generates all possible scenarios to come, so its running time is high. To significantly reduce the running time, we randomly sample a fixed number of scenarios (100) will little impact on accuracy. 

\subsection{Pot Size}
The pot sizes are grouped into categories with intervals of 

\subsection{Word Processing Software}

As detailed below, IJCAI has prepared and made available a set of
\LaTeX{} macros and a Microsoft Word template for use in formatting
your paper. If you are using some other word processing software (such
as WordPerfect, etc.), please follow the format instructions given
below and ensure that your final paper looks as much like this sample
as possible.

{\bf Note that I did not edit the word document, and it still contains the original IJCAI formatting instructions. Please ignore those!}

\section{Style and Format}

\LaTeX{} and Word style files that implement these instructions
can be retrieved electronically. (See Appendix~\ref{stylefiles} for
instructions on how to obtain these files.)

\subsection{Layout}

Print manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner in which these
instructions are printed. The exact dimensions for pages are:
\begin{itemize}
\item left and right margins: .75$''$
\item column width: 3.375$''$
\item gap between columns: .25$''$
\item top margin---first page: 1.375$''$
\item top margin---other pages: .75$''$
\item bottom margin: 1.25$''$
\item column height---first page: 6.625$''$
\item column height---other pages: 9$''$
\end{itemize}

All measurements assume an 8-1/2$''$ $\times$ 11$''$ page size. For
A4-size paper, use the given top and left margins, column width,
height, and gap, and modify the bottom and right margins as necessary.

\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}

For the production of the electronic manuscript, you must use Adobe's
{\em Portable Document Format} (PDF). A PDF file can be generated, for
instance, on Unix systems using {\tt ps2pdf} or on Windows systems
using Adobe's Distiller. There is also a website with free software
and conversion services: {\tt http://www.ps2pdf.com/}. For reasons of
uniformity, use of Adobe's {\em Times Roman} font is strongly suggested. In
\LaTeX2e{}, this is accomplished by putting
\begin{quote} 
\mbox{\tt $\backslash$usepackage\{times\}}
\end{quote}
in the preamble.\footnote{You may want also to use the package {\tt
latexsym}, which defines all symbols known from the old \LaTeX{}
version.}
  
Additionally, it is of utmost importance to specify the American {\bf
letter} format (corresponding to 8-1/2$''$ $\times$ 11$''$) when
formatting the paper. When working with {\tt dvips}, for instance, one
should specify {\tt -t letter}.

\subsection{Title and Author Information}

Center the title on the entire width of the page in a 14-point bold
font. The title should be capitalized using Title Case. Below it, center author name(s) in a 12-point bold font. On the following line(s) place the affiliations, each affiliation on its own line using a 12-point regular font. Matching between authors and affiliations can be done using superindices. Additionally, a comma-separated email addresses list using a 12-point regular font is also allowed. Credit to a
sponsoring agency can appear on the first page as a footnote.

\subsection{Text}

The main body of the text immediately follows the abstract. Use
10-point type in a clear, readable font with 1-point leading (10 on
11).

Indent when starting a new paragraph, except after major headings.

\subsection{Headings and Sections}

When necessary, headings should be used to separate major sections of
your paper. (These instructions use many headings to demonstrate their
appearance; your paper should have fewer headings.). All headings should be capitalized using Title Case.

\subsubsection{Section Headings}

Print section headings in 12-point bold type in the style shown in
these instructions. Leave a blank space of approximately 10 points
above and 4 points below section headings.  Number sections with
arabic numerals.

\subsubsection{Subsection Headings}

Print subsection headings in 11-point bold type. Leave a blank space
of approximately 8 points above and 3 points below subsection
headings. Number subsections with the section number and the
subsection number (in arabic numerals) separated by a
period.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection Headings}

Print subsubsection headings in 10-point bold type. Leave a blank
space of approximately 6 points above subsubsection headings. Do not
number subsubsections.

\subsubsection{Special Sections}

You may include an unnumbered acknowledgments section, including
acknowledgments of help from colleagues.

Any appendices directly follow the text and look like sections, except
that they are numbered with capital letters instead of arabic
numerals.

The references section is headed ``References,'' printed in the same
style as a section heading but without a number. A sample list of
references is given at the end of these instructions. Use a consistent
format for references, such as that provided by Bib\TeX{}. The reference
list should not include unpublished work.

\subsection{Citations}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
the year of publication, for example~\cite{gottlob:nonmon}.  Append
lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat multiple
authors as in the following examples:~\cite{abelson-et-al:scheme}
or~\cite{bgf:Lixto} (for more than two authors) and
\cite{brachman-schmolze:kl-one} (for two authors).  If the author
portion of a citation is obvious, omit it, e.g.,
Nebel~\shortcite{nebel:jair-2000}.  Collapse multiple citations as
follows:~\cite{gls:hypertrees,levesque:functional-foundations}.
\nocite{abelson-et-al:scheme}
\nocite{bgf:Lixto}
\nocite{brachman-schmolze:kl-one}
\nocite{gottlob:nonmon}
\nocite{gls:hypertrees}
\nocite{levesque:functional-foundations}
\nocite{levesque:belief}
\nocite{nebel:jair-2000}

\subsection{Footnotes}

Place footnotes at the bottom of the page in a 9-point font.  Refer to
them with superscript numbers.\footnote{This is how your footnotes
should appear.} Separate them from the text by a short
line.\footnote{Note the line separating these footnotes from the
text.} Avoid footnotes as much as possible; they interrupt the flow of
the text.

\section{Illustrations}

Place all illustrations (figures, drawings, tables, and photographs)
throughout the paper at the places where they are first discussed,
rather than at the end of the paper. If placed at the bottom or top of
a page, illustrations may run across both columns.

Illustrations must be rendered electronically or scanned and placed
directly in your document. All illustrations should be in black and
white, as color illustrations may cause problems. Line weights should
be 1/2-point or thicker. Avoid screens and superimposing type on
patterns as these effects may not reproduce well.

Number illustrations sequentially. Use references of the following
form: Figure 1, Table 2, etc. Place illustration numbers and captions
under illustrations. Leave a margin of 1/4-inch around the area
covered by the illustration and caption.  Use 9-point type for
captions, labels, and other text in illustrations.
